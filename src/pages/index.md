    content: >-
      Software Engineer focused on Development, Designing and Data Science. I am expert in development of software solutions including Web and Mobile applications. Alongside this I keep myself up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools in the market.

As far as my skills are concerned, I have experience in development life-cycle, testing and project management. Machine learning is the core area of my focus apart from my software engineering projects and I have employed these skills on some areas of machine learning research like Anomaly detection, Predictive analytics, Natural Language Processing etc.

Currently my working stack revolves around JavaScript and I am expert in ReactJS, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB but I enjoy working on any new technologies to keep myself up and running with trends in industry.

Being a lead Front-End Engineer at Saaya Health, my responsibilities are impact-full and widespread and managing all the development work here imparts me good management skills. So, if you have something to discuss with me regarding all these things, then connect with me at 'saeed_dev@yahoo.com'. I look forward to speaking with you.
